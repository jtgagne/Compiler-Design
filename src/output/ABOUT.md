This directory contains all output files generated by the parser.  
All files log the type castings, warnings, environment info, assignments, and tokens encountered during parsing.  
Each of the output files corresponds to a .nat file located in the src/test directory.  
Any changes made in a .nat file in the src/test directory will be updated in its corresponding output file.
