# Compiler-Design
Compiler for Natural. Semester project in Compiler Design at Wentworth Institute of Technology Summer 2016.

# Testing the Parser
1. Locate the Test.java file in the parser package.
2. Run the main method from that class.

All the files in the /src/test/ directory will be scanned in by the lexer and checked for syntax correctness by the parser. The files in the test/ directory beginning with E contain errors that should be found by the parser. The remaining files, all starting numbers should not display any errors when being parsed.
